# Loan-Data-Analysis
This assignment was given by upGrad where I had to perform a thorough analysis of loan data provided by LendingClub to analysis the characteristics of loan being default.
The initial dataset provided to us had 111 columns with 39716 entries.
Later, I broke it down to columns that were usefull only.
The analysis is in step by step, easy to understand manner, followed with a detailed summary of most important insights and obervations with conclusion.
